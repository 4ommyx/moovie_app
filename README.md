# 🎥 Moovie App : Personalized Movie Recommendation App 🍿

Moovie App is a movie recommendation system that helps you discover movies similar to the ones you love. It leverages advanced **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to ensure you get recommendations tailored to your preferences.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - The app uses data from the **`genres`** and **`keywords`** columns of the dataset.  
   - These features are combined to create a meaningful representation of each movie.

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
   - We apply **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to calculate the importance of each term in the context of a specific movie.  
   - This step ensures that unique and descriptive terms are emphasized, while common terms are downplayed.

3. **Similarity Measurement**  
   - The app uses **cosine similarity** to compute the level of similarity between the selected movie and all other movies in the dataset.  
   - Cosine similarity evaluates how closely the vector representations of two movies align, helping identify the most similar movies.

4. **Recommendations**  
   - Based on the calculated similarity scores, the app suggests movies with the highest similarity to the user's selected movie.
